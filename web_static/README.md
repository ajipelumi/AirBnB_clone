## Web Static
This part of the project is focused on building the front-end for managing our **AirBnB** objects.

We start by creating simple **HTML** static pages and a style guide, with fake content.
No **Javascript** or data loaded from external sources is used during this stage.

The purpose of this part of the project is to learn how to manipulate **HTML** and **CSS** languages, as HTML is the structure of the page and CSS is the design.
