## Web Static
This part of project is focused on building a front-end for managing our **AirBnB** objects, step-by-step.

Before developing our complex web application, we started by creating simple **HTML** static pages and a style guide, with fake content.
No Javascript or data loaded from external sources is used during this stage.
The purpose of this stage of the project is to learn how to manipulate **HTML** and **CSS** languages, as HTML is the structure of the page and CSS is the design.
